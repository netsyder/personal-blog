## Welcome to my blog

From some time I've been looking for a way to try out new technologies and concepts, and at the same time showcase the knowledge that I've been aquiring... After some thought the answer became pretty obvious: MAKE A BLOG!

This blog will be hosting whatever I'm entertained with outside work, and I will be focused in selfhosting, virtualization, containerization, cloud management, and IT in general.

Currently this site is hosted on a GitHub repo and it is being published using Netlify and Cloudflare... maybe one day I'll selfhost it just for the lolz.

Thanks for checking this out and I hope that the time you spend in here helps you in any form, from learning something new, refresh some knowledge, or simple entertainment.

See you in the next one.
